1.  **Inspiration**
    Have a unique website that acctaully shows off my skills in react rather than just using basic landing web deisgns

2.  **Purpose**

Due to this being a card game I will need to demonstrate varios skills such as

> AI for the opponents turn
> Drag and drop
> State saving between secessions
> Storing live data in database to be used in real time (maybe sockets of channels)
> Will hopefully be using a .net backend with a detached frontend
